            <h1>My bio.</h1>
        </header>
        <p class="narrative">
            I was born on this land in 1987. 
            A confused little boy I was, 
            living amongst the most <strong>eccentric</strong> of adults 
            in one of the <em>busiest</em> parts of the world.
        </p>
        <h3>The move.</h3>
        <p class="narrative">
            One day, I was uprooted. Plopped down on a new land--
            a very different land--I suddenly felt lost.<br>But I picked myself
            up and kept marching forward
        </p>
        <h3>Basketball.</h3>
        <p class="narrative">
            Then came along my first love. Some may argue my last love too.
            I went in deep and didn't look back for the next 12 years.
            What a relationship that was. And what a heartbreak.
        </p>
        <h3>Passing it <strong>forward</strong>.</h3>
        <p class="narrative">
            Here I am, back where I started this journey. And I am about
            to go to my first business meeting to make this journey 
            possible for others. The world keeps turning. <br>And new dreams 
            are born every day.
